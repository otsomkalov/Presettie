Include/exclude/ignore liked tracks - how to utilize liked tracks during the process of generation\n2. Enable/disable recommendations - either ask Spotify to get recommendations for tracks or not\n3. Playlist size - the amount of tracks to be put into *targeted playlists*\n\nA few use cases:\n1. *Don't listen twice*\nTrack already listened songs by automatically putting them into *targeted playlist* and exclude them from the next generations\n2. *Fresh Daily Mixes*\nExclude your liked tracks from Daily Mixes and listen to the fresh mixes\n3. *Get recommendations for your liked tracks*\nCreate preset with included liked tracks and receive recommendations right into *targeted playlist*\n4. *Randomize your liked tracks*\nInclude your liked tracks and put them into *targeted playlist* in random order\n\nPrivacy: /privacy\nGuide: /guide\nFAQ: /faq" },
